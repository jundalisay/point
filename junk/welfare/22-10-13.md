Each bag with unique patterns translates to interest as a collectible item or to share as a gift for this coming Christmas season.


## Smile Train Foundation

In this empowering fashion, a functional item like a bag nowadays becomes more than just a fashion statement or chic flex but emanates a sublime meaning that’s helping humanity. The wearable concept is also close to the heart of the artist as VIRRCO intends to bridge art to fashion and advocacy as they are after all complementing each other. As he did in the past, this time it's an honor to have Smile Train Foundation as a beneficiary.

Witness the unveiling of VIRRCO’s brand of celebratory sensibilities thru these hand-painted bags that will truly give one an allure and wow outlook.


## One Eyed Women

His first official breakthrough exhibit entitled "One Eyed Women" was launched in December 2021 at MetLive Atrium in Macapagal with an impressive reception from both art appreciators and buyers benefitting the AIDS victims. His second exhibit at SM Centerpoint came last June 12 in celebration of Independence Day featuring his definitive portraits and artworks, a feast of his masterpiece.
