## About the Company

Pantrypoints Technologies is a small tech startup building a moneyless economic system that uses points as the store of value, and apps as the tool of trade as a solution to poverty, inequality, unemployment, recessions, and stagflation. 

We cater to micro and small businesses, helping them digitize into websites, web and mobile apps, and social media.

Aside from this, we are also advocating Village Contract Farming, Superphysics (the combination of science and metaphysics), and Maharlikanism (rebranding the Philippines into Maharlika). We also support social impact groups such as Food Rescue Philippines and activities such as animal shelters, recycling, and feeding programs for the poor.
