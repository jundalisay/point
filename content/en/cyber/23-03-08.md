<!-- Alibabacloud, huawei cloud, azure, AWS, Google, Red Hat -->

Red Hat Openshift specializes in cloud-based containers which is useful for hyperscalers. 

It uses containers that are organized into pods via Kubernetes 'orchestration'. This has the following advantages:
- containerized apps can scale quickly via horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling through an autoscaling service that operates on container labels
- development, as well as CI/CD, can be organized and isolated 
- CI/CD can be automated

It aims to shift cloud computing to the 'left' towards app development by automating CI/CD.


## Openshift Versus Kubernetes Engine, AWS EKS, Azure Kubernetes

Openshift bundles its services into a single package which makes it quick and easy for developers to set up and deploy their entperprise apps on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is more secure than other linux distributions. 

Moreoever, users are not locked in to a single provider -- they are able to "shift" to other providers like AWS, IBM, Google, etc. 

However, this makes it more expensive than other providers.
