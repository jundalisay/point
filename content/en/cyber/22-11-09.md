### Decode 2022 Goes Downhill with Philippine Startup Week

Overall, this year's DEVCON and Philippine Startup Week were far inferior to pre-pandemic ones. 

In 2019 for example, the BIR supported the startup movement through their Hackatax. There was a lot of talk on artificial intelligence, data science, and even IoT. 

This year, moderator Christopher Star actually bashed the BIR during the panel discussion. 

The degradation of the startup movement from 2020 is quite obvious -- the Ethereum expert's talk was on using **Github pages** to serve Web3!
