## Ruby

Ruby has dynamic typing. It uses arrows for inheritance.

Among topics discussed were:

- Rails model
- Scaffolding
- Console
- Bootstrap
- Asset Pipeline 
- Fingerprinting which is used for updating global cache to make sure it is up to date


<!-- # lists

Rails model, asset pipeline 

fingerprint is for updating cache  -->
