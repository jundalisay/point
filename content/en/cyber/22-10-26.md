## Update: October 27

### An Endless Journey 

We arrived before lunch where Cathy Yang was interviewing Magic Johnson and what his current and planned investments. PLDT seems to be betting a lot on the NBA since there really isn't a connection between Magic and future telecoms technlogy or the metaverse. 

### Women Power Panel 

After lunch, women leaders formed a panel to talk about women leading digital transformation. 

### Fellowship Night

The last event was a Fellowship Night with Ely Buendia and dinner


## Update: October 28

<!-- ### The Hyperscale Revolution  -->

### Emerging Technologies

Top companies gave talks on how they used Emerging Technologies in their own digital transformation. Included was AIoT which is the merger of AI and IoT. 

<!-- metaverse is barter  -->

Nokia gave a talk about communication service providers (CSPs) and  Communication Platforms as a Service (CPaaS). <!-- Nokia giving --> Grab was an example -- Grab relies heavily on Google Maps to find drivers and passengers. 



### Sulong Forward by Joey Concepcion


### Digital Hesitation

<!-- CSP is locked unable to use by enterprise. 

Data is locked by Google and AWS.  -->

<!-- Network as a code. 

coin cards are invoice and redeipts -->
