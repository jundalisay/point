Mr. Gendrano highlighted that this year’s edition will carry the theme Boundless, aligned with how enterprises of all sizes have been resilient and capable of reaching new heights amid crisis.

<p>The recent years presented businesses with restrictions that challenged their pursuit for growth, yet they persevered. For this year’s PH Digicon, we aim to capitalize on lessons learned from the pandemic for them to fully grasp their ability to be Boundless. This event offers an excellent platform for all industry stakeholders to explore the possibilities gained from digital transformation. We are all excited to discover what the future holds for different enterprises. Though restrictions have eased for in-person engagements, we will implement the necessary health protocols to ensure that our attendees will have a safe physical event experience</p>
