Heroku will end Free Dynos starting November 28. Users on the free plan will be 'upgraded' to the 'Eco plan' which is $5 per month for 1,000 dyno hours.  

For those on such a plan, we suggest leaving Heroku and moving to Firebase, Netlify, Gigalixir, Render, etc as the Eco plan is really bad value for money.
