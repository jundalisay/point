This year's event focused on the role of machine learning such as Sagemaker for enterprise.  

As always, it was quite challenging to remember all of AWS services, from Sagemaker, Blue, Athena, etc. 

## Demo

AWS gave trial accounts to use the machine learning. The technical session used PySpark, Pandas, and PyArrow for ETL and data manipulation.  


## AWS Lift

Interesting was the AWS Lift program which gave $750 free credits for machine learning. 

We asked how they compare with Google Colab, a free service, which we already use a lot. They said AWS machine learning was competitive because it had built in services that did common tasks like classification, detection, language processing, etc.
