Alibaba Cloud powers the Alibaba group just like AWS powers Amazon. <!-- The main difference is the pricing, and how -->


## Update: January 9


Alibaba technical experts showed the power of Alibaba cloud. They offer a free trial which amounts to only a few hundred pesos.

Alibaba would be a good service if your startup wants to expand into China as they already know how to meet the regulations of the Chinese government regarding network connectivity. It would be nice to what Huawei Cloud has to offer compared to Alibaba Cloud.
