The Science for Change Program (S4CP) of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) won in the 2022 United Nations Public Service Awards (UNPSA). 

During the UN Public Service Day event, the United Nations recognized the contribution of the Science for Change Program in “Enhancing the effectiveness of public institutions to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” 

They added, “Your institution’s outstanding achievement has demonstrated excellence in serving the public interest and it has made a significant contribution to the improvement of public administration in your country. Indeed, it will serve as an inspiration and encouragement for others working for public service.” 

The S4CP endeavors to significantly accelerate Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) in the country through massive increase in investment in S&T Human Resource Development (HRD) and Research and Development (R&D).

“This is a milestone for DOST. We are grateful and honored to the UNPSA for giving this prestigious recognition to the Science for Change Program. The S4CP has embarked on a journey to capitalize on the importance of R&D in achieving socio-economic development through research collaboration and cooperation between and among industry, academe, and research institutions to improve productivity and global competitiveness,” said DOST Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña.
