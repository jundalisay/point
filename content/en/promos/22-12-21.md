The Bureau of Plant Industry of Plant Industry is giving away free seeds and fertilizers at its Manila and Los Banos sites. 

Even before the pandemic, the Bureau of Plant Industry of Plant Industry has been giving away these for free. However, the long pandemic gave rise to the home gardening as many people were stuck at home with nothing to do. This, together with the inflation of food prices after the Russia-Ukraine war, has further increased the demand for seeds and seedlings. 

The Bureau of Plant Industry of Plant Industry gives the following per person:
- 1 set of seeds, usually composed of pechay, mustard, beans, okra, and ampalaya
- A few seedlings 

We found that the Los Banos site is a bit more generous in giving both. It is also near the Los Banos Municipal Hall were more seeds are available for residents, and a few kilometers from University of the Philippines where there are a lot of agriculture experts.

## How to Get Even More Seeds

Each Local Government (LGU) has an agriculture office where its residents can get seeds from. Some LGUs, like San Pedro Laguna and Las Pinas also   give free fertilizers. 

Some LGUs are generous enough to allow non-residents to get seeds. However, some, like Bay in Laguna does not. 

The most generous LGU was San Pedro Laguna where they give up to 5 sets for free during their Weekend Market.
