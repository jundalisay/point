## The Point on Mr. DIY

We started buying gardening tools at Mr. DIY after [the Agrilink Exhibit at World Trade Center last October](/agri/22-10-06).

They are the second cheapest source of tools and non-food items after Divimart which was suggested by Franz, one of the founders of The Point.

Divimart might be the cheapest, but they have a smaller selection of tools. Mr DIY has are some items that we couldn't find in Divimart such as:
- a bigger variety of gardening and home tools such as foldable saw and wallboard saw
- cheaper kitchen stuff like scouring pads, steel wool, and toiletries
