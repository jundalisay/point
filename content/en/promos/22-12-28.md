Inflation started spiking in 2022 after the supply chain disrutions in 2021 and the Russian invasion in February. 

DALI introduced the concept of 'hard discounts' where permanent discounts are given for a fixed range of products. 

For December 28, 2022 to January 14, 2023, their 'special buys' are listed on their site: https://www.dali.ph/what-s-new

## The Point on DALI

We noticed that the prices in DALI are cheaper than regular grocery items even at Puregold or Super 8. 

They did raise their white bread to 37 pesos which is near the 38.50 of Pinoy Tasty set by the DTI. Their eggs were also raised to 7 pesos.

However, these are **still lower** than palengke (wet market) prices. 

It makes us wonder why would anyone still go to Alfamart when DALI has the basics covered. 


<!-- Q. How do I become an DALI Supplier?

A. Write us an email  at suppliers@dali.ph and you will receive our New Supplier Application Form. In addition, you are welcome to complete up to four Supplemental Submission Forms for each additional item. 

Q. What is a core range item?

A. A core range item is an item that we sell everyday in our stores.
 
Q. What is Private Label?

A. Private Label refers to our own brand name on our products. Many of our products are proprietary DALI brands. DALI private label product quality meets or exceeds the equivalent national brands sold in other national retail chains. It is different to the usual known house brand of supermarkets. We focus on providing the same quality like the leading brand that we intend to replace but with significantly lower cost as the supplier does not need to spend on marketing, promotions, research etc.

 

Q. What is a Display Ready Case (DRC)?

A.  A Display Ready Case refers to the outer case that should be ready-to-merchandise within our DALI stores which eliminates the need for per-item-unit merchandising. A DRC must have the following attributes:

Easy to open and easy to display on shelf

Allows the products to be shopped easily

Stable and can protect the products throughout transit
