The event will talk about how to close the gap with "gender lens investing" as well as the updates for the Community. 


## Update Nov 17

The event was held at the same time as the Agritech Summit by Agfunder which was far more interesting.

It's strange for Villgro to be part of the Philippine Startup Week which is a failed event, by our standards. The Agritech Summit was not part of the Philippine Startup Week and was far better and more effective.
