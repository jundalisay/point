The event is the go-to platform that brings top industry professionals, experts, and service providers in the Philippines together to discuss the latest trends and technological innovations needed to reset and grow the retail business in the post-pandemic era. This is the first time since 2019 that NRCE will provide large-scale networking, learning, and collaboration in a live physical manner.
