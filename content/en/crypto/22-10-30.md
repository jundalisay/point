## History

### 2015: Ethereum

DeFi began with Ethereum which launched in 2015. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum had a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity and the ERC20 standard. 

<!--  and quickly started attracting more and more developers who wanted to build all kinds of decentralized applications – ranging from games, such as CryptoKitties, to financial applications.  -->

Ethereum led to the DAI "stablecoin" which used the Maker protocol -- you use Ethereum to get DAI. <!--  that allows for creating a decentralized stable coin – DAI. The project was formed in 2014 by Rune Christensen who was inspired by another project BitShares – a blockchain created by Dan Larimer. -->


### 2017: ICOs

Ethereum also led to 'initial coin offerings" or ICOs in 2017 where cryptocurrencies were used to finance tech startups. Notable ICOs were on-chain liquidity protocols:

- Kyber Network
- Bancor 

The ICOs had their typical rise and fall pattern. 


### 2019: Stablecoins and NFTs

After the fall of ICOs, stablecoins and NFTs were popularized next, also with their own rise and falls. 


### 2020: Pandemic

The pandemic locked in a lot of people at home, causing them to try cryptocurrencies. As a result, they rose a lot, only to fall in 2021 and 2022. 

<!-- Development of Maker was funded by Venture Capital and was eventually launched at the end of 2017. The first iteration of the protocol – Single Collateral DAI – supported only ETH as collateral
 -->

## CeFi versus DeFi

CeFi means Centralized Finance. A central exchange handles all crypto trade orders.

DeFi means Decentralized Finance. There is no central exchange. People instead use an app to do all crypto trade orders.

You usually go through CeFi to go to DeFi. 
 

CeFi | DeFi
--- | ---
Coinbase -- a cryptocurrency exchange | Totle -- an aggregator of decentralized liquidity with automatic price optimization
Fairlay -- a Bitcoin Prediction Market and Exchange | Augur -- a decentralized predictions market
BlockFi -- a cryptocurrency and fiat borrowing and lending platform | Nexus Mutual -- A decentralized insurance tool
Celsius -- a cryptocurrency borrowing, payments and lending platform | Kyber -- A decentralized exchange
Ledn -- an insured Bitcoin to DAI borrowing and lending platform | Maker DAO -- a decentralized stablecoin minting and lending tool
Libra -- a global financial infrastructure and cryptocurrency layer | bZx -- a decentralized lending and margin trading platform


<!-- that facilitates trading, borrowing, margin trading, native stablecoin, lending, payments and more. -->


<!-- fungible: non-unique divisible (Bitcoin)
non-fungible: unique and nondivisible (NFT)

NFT get their value by the celebrity in the chain of transactions: This was owned by Bill Gates. Same metaphysics as an autographed item. 

Key is marketing. Thought more important it is for NFTs. 

Token is data managed by an instance of a smart contract. 

Fungible tokens belong to the same contract

Ethreum standards or templates:

ERC-20 FT

ERC-721 NFT

FT has:
- Name
- Symbol
- Total Supply
- Balance

NFT has:
- Owner
- Token ID


Wallet

app that acts like a local database for keys and interact with the blockchain 


DeFi

Evolution of fintech that uses blockchain and eliminates 3rd party intermediaries. 

Interest rates are based on Yield Farming via Automatic Market Makers through liquidity pool and asset swapping. 

NFT is made divisible by tokenization through liquidity pools


## Pubic Blockchain and Gas Fees in Qwei

Transaction = Sender + Recipient + Payload + Gas + Signatures



Layer 2 Protocols

Additional layer that acts as a private network to make Ethereum transactions cheaper. 



Hyperledger Fabric does not use crypto. Create NFT then transfer it. 

Smart contracts are called chaincode in Hyperledger
