## History

### 2015: Ethereum

DeFi began with Ethereum which launched in 2015. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum had a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity and the ERC20 standard. 

<!--  and quickly started attracting more and more developers who wanted to build all kinds of decentralized applications – ranging from games, such as CryptoKitties, to financial applications.  -->

Ethereum led to the DAI "stablecoin" which used the Maker protocol -- you use Ethereum to get DAI. <!--  that allows for creating a decentralized stable coin – DAI. The project was formed in 2014 by Rune Christensen who was inspired by another project BitShares – a blockchain created by Dan Larimer. -->


### 2017: ICOs

Ethereum also led to 'initial coin offerings" or ICOs in 2017 where cryptocurrencies were used to finance tech startups. Notable ICOs were on-chain liquidity protocols:

- Kyber Network
- Bancor 

The ICOs had their typical rise and fall pattern. 


### 2019: Stablecoins and NFTs

After the fall of ICOs, stablecoins and NFTs were popularized next, also with their own rise and falls. 


### 2020: Pandemic

The pandemic locked in a lot of people at home, causing them to try cryptocurrencies. As a result, they rose a lot, only to fall in 2021 and 2022. 

<!-- Development of Maker was funded by Venture Capital and was eventually launched at the end of 2017. The first iteration of the protocol – Single Collateral DAI – supported only ETH as collateral
 -->

## CeFi versus DeFi

CeFi means Centralized Finance. A central exchange handles all crypto trade orders.

DeFi means Decentralized Finance. There is no central exchange. People instead use an app to do all crypto trade orders.

You usually go through CeFi to go to DeFi.
