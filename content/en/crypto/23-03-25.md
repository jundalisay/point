## What is Genesis Universe?

Genesis Universe is a metaverse exploration game based on ancient mythologies using mythical characters from all over the world:

- Japan
- China
- Egypt
- India
- Nordics

Select a faction to play the game. 

By offering the NPC in the faction proper materials, the NPC will spawn a hero that adapts to the new world and battles. The Hero Card NFT and tokens obtained will be deposited to Wallet as on-chain assets.
