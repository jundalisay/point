The event will feature NFTs and games using blockchain.

## Update: May 1

There were a lot of gaming companies and crypto companies during the event. There was also a lot of food and live entertainment -- the end of the show featured the band Kamikaze.

This is the most awesome blockchain event we've ever attended and are thankful to the organizers for holding an event to educate people about NFT, The Metaverse, and GameFi.
