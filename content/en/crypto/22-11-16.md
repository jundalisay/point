## An Alternative to Ethereum

Tezos is a French blockchain platform that strives to be an alternative to Ethereum. 

Ethereum | Tezos 
--- | ---
ERC-20 | FA2
Solidity | Ligolang and Michelson
Minting | Baking 


SmartPy began in 2019 to make blockchain programming available in Python. 


### Ligolang

Ligolang is a high level language that works similar to Solidity. 


We tried Tezos during their Draper event today and used [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) which is an open-source developer platform for remote development. Unfortunately, there was little time to focus on coding and the moderator simply rushed the tutorial. 

It would have been better if the event simply started on time at 6pm so that there would've been more time for coding. Instead, it started very late and so the actual tutorial had to be rushed as a consequence.  


<!-- ### SparkPoint

The startup SparkPoint gave a presentation on their products and services. The most interesting of which was SparkLearn EdTech where they teach blockchain development online, similar to how [Avion](https://www.avionschool.com/) or [Coderschool.vn](https://coderschool.vn).
