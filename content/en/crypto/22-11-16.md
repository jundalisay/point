## An Alternative to Ethereum

Tezos is a French blockchain platform that strives to be an alternative to Ethereum. 

Ethereum | Tezos 
--- | ---
ERC-20 | FA2
Solidity | Ligolang and Michelson
Minting | Baking 


SmartPy began in 2019 to make blockchain programming available in Python. 


### Ligolang

Ligolang is a high level language that works similar to Solidity. 


We tried Tezos during their Draper event today and used [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) which is an open-source developer platform for remote development.


<!-- ### SparkPoint

The startup SparkPoint gave a presentation on their products and services. The most interesting of which was SparkLearn EdTech where they teach blockchain development online, similar to how [Avion](https://www.avionschool.com/) or [Coderschool.vn](https://coderschool.vn).
