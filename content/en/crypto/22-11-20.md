If you haven't had your fill of blockchain, crypto, and NFTs last week in the Philippine Web3 Festival and the Philippine Startup Week, then the Philippine Blockchain Week 2022 is for you. 

[Tickets](https://www.philblockchainweek.com/tickets/) are more expensive than the Philippine Web3 Festival:

Type | Price
--- | ---
Expo | 27.5 USD
Premium | 314.5 USD
VIP | 524.5 USD
VVIP | 2500 USD

It's our first time to hear of a VVIP category for an event. 

Like the Philippine Web3 Festival, there are many side events for specific type of ticket holders. 

The week will culminate with a 'Philippine Block Awards' on December 2, and a Block X Afterparty on December 3 and 4. 


## Update Day 1: Awesome!

Before lunch, selected Web3 startups gave pitches. Among them was Crypto Sheesh which was a favorite during the Web3 Hackathon.

The most interesting session was the panel discussion with the Tron founder who was asked what he did during the FTX collapse and how much of FTX assets he owns. He replied that he does not have majority ownership. The discussion ended with Justin Sun advocating more trust for DeFi over CeFi.

## Update Day 3: Talks Talks Talks
