If you haven't had your fill of blockchain, crypto, and NFTs last week in the Philippine Web3 Festival and the Philippine Startup Week, then the Philippine Blockchain Week 2022 is for you. 

[Tickets](https://www.philblockchainweek.com/tickets/) are more expensive than the Philippine Web3 Festival:

Type | Price
--- | ---
Expo | 27.5 USD
Premium | 314.5 USD
VIP | 524.5 USD
VVIP | 2500 USD

It's our first time to hear of a VVIP category for an event. 

Like the Philippine Web3 Festival, there are many side events for specific type of ticket holders. 

The week will culminate with a 'Philippine Block Awards' on December 2, and a Block X Afterparty on December 3 and 4.
