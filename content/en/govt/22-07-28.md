Filipino Individuals and Overseas Organizations 2021 Presidential Awards Recipients


The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) is pleased to announce to the public the fifty-six (56) distinguished and outstanding overseas Filipinos and foreign-based organizations from 20 countries and territories who will be honored by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte with the 2021 Presidential Awards for Filipino Individuals and Organizations Overseas (PAFIOO).

Institutionalized in 1991 through Executive Order No. 498, the PAFIOO is a biennial search for overseas-based organizations or individuals who have dedicated their work in the service of Filipinos in the Philippines or abroad, selflessly supported relief, rehabilitation, and development programs in the home country, or excelled in their field of work or profession.

The awardees were selected from a total of 117 nominations received by the CFO-PAFIOO Secretariat since it opened the nominations in August 2019. These nominations came from 31 countries and were endorsed by 39 Philippine Foreign Service Posts across Asia, North and South America, Europe, and Australia.

The awardees were thoroughly screened through a 4-stage evaluation process. The first stage consisted of an evaluation by the Awards Screening Committee established and convened by the Philippine Foreign Service Posts. 

Nominees endorsed by the Posts went through the second stage of the evaluation process by an eight-member inter-agency Technical Committee composed of senior representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Department of Health (DOH), National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), De La Salle University (representing the academe), Center for Migrant Advocacy (representing the migrant NGO), and the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) as the Chair.

Nominees whose ratings met the passing rate were further screened by a multi-sectoral Executive Committee headed by the CFO and comprised of senior officials and representatives from the DFA, Office of the Presidential Protocol, Episcopal Commission for Pastoral Care for Migrants, and Itinerant People (representing the religious sector), Dynamic Outsource Solutions 1 Inc. (representing the private sector), and GMA Network, Inc. (representing the media). A shortlist was then submitted to the Office of the President for final evaluation and approval.
Details of the awarding ceremony are to be announced at a later time owing to the fluidity of circumstances in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

1. Lingkod sa Kapwa Pilipino (LINKAPIL)
