<!-- The formal launch of the 1st Freedom Festival 2022 at Vespa Cafe -->

The 2-day event will feature talks by:

- DTI BSMED
- Kalibrr
- Regus
- DigitalFilipino
- Mercato Central
- Amor Maclang


## Update: Nov 25

The event was smaller than we expected, but was packed with people. Most of the attendees were business owners and students.

The most important booth to us was the Tax Help booth where we could ask about the differences between the incentives or tax breaks of:
- Barangay Micro Business Enterprise BMBE 
- BOI Incentives
- PEZA 

The Tax Help staff explained that PEZA is the most complicated, followed by the BOI. A BMBE is extremely simple by comparison. They suggested that new micro-small business should start as BMBE then incorporate into a 2-person corporation instead of a 1-person corporation after the revenues exceed 3m pesos.
