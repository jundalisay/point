The in-person conference was originally due to take place on March 21-23, 2022. But a unanimous decision was made to push back the event given the disruptions caused by the Omicron variant in Asia.

The new July dates take into consideration the expected continued reopening of the region’s travel borders and rising vaccination rates in the Philippines.

The most important aspect of our ASEAN Gaming Summit conference is being able to offer our delegates and sponsors a complete package of networking opportunities and educational content. We believe our new July dates will be able to achieve this whilst providing safety and security for our attendees,” said Felix Ng, conference director at Asia Gaming Brief.

Our conference has always been about fostering new and old business connections within the Asian gaming industry… and after two years of not being able to run an in-person gathering of gaming executives, we’re really excited to be able to work on it again this year.
