## Waste of Time

This is our first time to attend a Go Negosyo event and we throughly regret it. We were expecting some networking event or some rundown of the impact Go Negosyo on the Philippine economy.

Instead, we encountered mere self-promotion of the speakers' businesses. 

The talks were shallow and cheap. Proof is the vlogger Mall Laude making an appearance with her drone, saying nothing other than her tagline. 

It was disappointing that none of the influencers discussed taxation issues or how influencers should register or file with the BIR.
