More than a hobby, motorbikers have come a long way in using mobility to conduct relief operations and other socio-civic activities. They have evolved as an extension support system serving unreached and needy communities which is what Sons of Luzon have been practicing for the past few years.

Certainly not to be missed is the custom bike competition courtesy of Lycan Motors for those custom bike aficionados plus exhibitions from the experts and members of different motor clubs. That's why Mr. Odhey Isip, the group secretary, was encouraging more clubs to participate and celebrate with an opportunity to bond with one another and put the Philippines on the map of responsible motorbikers with a heart.  Gain friends and learn new trends on the latest technology. Expect big personalities to grace the occasion and even celebrities.
