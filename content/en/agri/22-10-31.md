Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is the second most important vegetable crop next to potato. 

The present world production is about 100 million tons fresh fruit from 3.7 million ha. (FAOSTAT, 2001).


## Low Yields

Low yield happens when there are:
- daytime temperatures above 25ºC 
- night temperatures above 2OºC 
- high humidity
  - This leads to a greater incidence of pests and diseases and fruit rotting
- strong winds
- low sunshine 

<!-- lead to excessive vegetative growth and poor fruit production.  -->

Yield decrease at various ECe values: 
- 0% at ECe 2.5 mmhos/cm
- 10% at 3.5, 25% at 5.0
- 50% at 7.6
- 100% at ECe 12.5 mmhos/cm

Dry climates are therefore preferred for tomato production.
 
In the nursery, the row distance is about 10 cm. In the field spacing ranges from 0.3/0.6 x 0.6/1 m with a population of about 40,000 plants per ha. 

The crop should be grown in a rotation with crops such as maize, cabbage, cowpea, to reduce pests and disease infestations.

The crop is moderately sensitive to soil salinity. 


The most sensitive period to salinity is during germination and early plant development, and necessary leaching of salts is therefore frequently practised during pre-irrigation or by over-watering during the initial irrigation application.

Highest yields of salad tomatoes are obtained by frequent, light irrigation. 

Where mechanical harvesting is used, heavy, infrequent irrigation is more appropriate with the last irrigation applied long before harvest.


<!-- Over 80 percent of the total water uptake occurs in the first 0.5 to 0.7 m and 100 per-cent of the water uptake of a full grown crop occurs from the first 0.7 to 1.5 m (D = 0.7 - 1.5 m). Under conditions when maximum evapotranspiration (ETm) is 5 to 6 mm/ day water uptake to meet full crop water requirements is affected when more than 40 percent of the total available soil water has been depleted (p = 0.4).

Irrigation Scheduling
The crop performance is sensitive to the irrigation practices. In general a prolonged severe water deficit limits growth and reduces yields which cannot be corrected by heavy watering later on. Highest demand for water is during flowering. however, withholding irrigation during this period is sometimes recommended to force less mature plants into flowering in order to obtain uniform flowering and ripening. Care should be exercised in this to avoid damage to the mature plants.

Excessive watering during the flowering period (2) has been shown to increase flower drop and reduce fruit set. Also this may cause excessive vegetative growth and a delay in ripening. Water supply during and after fruit set must be limited to a rate which will prevent stimulation of new growth at the expense of fruit development. Heavy, irregular irrigations or dry periods alternating with wet periods should be avoided. For production of salad tomato with more than one harvest, the crop flourishes best under light, frequent irrigation, well-distributed over the growing period with the soil depletion level during the different growth periods remaining below 40 percent (p < 0.4). This promotes optimum growth during the total growing period and results in high yield of good quality. With one harvest uniform ripening is required and the depletion level during this period may increase to 60 to 70 percent.

When water supply is limited, application for a salad crop can be concentrated during periods of transplanting, flowering (2) and yield formation (3). For a crop grown for paste production, a more extensive irrigation may be applied with last heavy irrigation applied prior to flowering.

Irrigation Methods
Surface irrigation by furrow is commonly practised. Under sprinkler irrigation the occurrence of fungal diseases and possibly bacterial canker may become a major problem. Further, under sprinkler, fruit set may be reduced with an increase in fruit rotting. In the case of poor quality water, leaf burn will occur with sprinkler irriga-tion; this may be reduced by sprinkling at night and shifting of sprinkler lines with the direction of the prevailing wind. Due to the crops specific demands for a high soil water content achieved without leaf wetting, trickle or drip irrigation has been successfully applied.

Yield
Frequent light irrigation improve the size, shape, juiciness and colour of the fruit, but total solids (dry matter content) and acid content will be reduced. However, the decrease in solids will lower the fruit quality for processing. In selecting the irrigation practices consideration must therefore be given to teh type of end product required. Prolonged water deficits leads to fruit cracking. Where fruit rot is a problem, frequent sprinkler irrigation should be avoided during the period of yield formation.

## High Yields

A good commercial yield under irrigation is 45-65 tons/ha fresh fruit, of which 80-90% is moisture. 

The water utilization efficiency for harvested yield (Ey) for fresh tomatoes is 10-12 kg/m3
