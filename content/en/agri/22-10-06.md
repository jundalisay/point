This year's agrilink was bigger than ever, with so many exhibitors compared to the previous events. 

Agriculture is a very important focus of the Marcos government, with the President himself acting as head of Agriculture. 

Notable exhibitors were:

- Villar Sipag which gave free compost
- East West Seed, Ruk Zwaan, and Kaneco Seed
