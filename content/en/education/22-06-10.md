## Update: June 10

According to Mr. Greenhawk's talk, he lived in a rural area in the US. This made his heart close to nature and led him to study frogs and reptiles. 

Thanks to the Fulbright scholarship, he was able to go to Los Banos in the Philippines to breed captive endangered frogs. From this, he was able to network with big NGOs and set up his own foundation.
