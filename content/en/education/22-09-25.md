IDP will have its International Education Fair and IELTS seminar at Dusit Thani.


## Update: Sept 25

The event ended early at 5pm because of the supertyphoon. 

The countries showcased were:
- New Zealand
- UK
- Australia
- Canada

### Canada

Canada had the easiest and cheapest entry because of their aggressive migration policy. The Canadian universities caught our attention because of their relatively easy requirements and low cost.
