GLOBIS is a Japanese university that offers 1 year MBA classes to foreign students. Its dean, Satoshi Hirose, will be in Makati and Cebu to hold a trial class and encourage students to sign up.

## Update: October 20

Last month, we attended the IDP Education Fair and highlighted the low cost and easy requirements of Canadian Universities, as part of their push to populate Canada. 

In Asia, the main universities in competition are usually those from Japan and Singapore. So how does GLOBIS stack up against Singaporean MBA courses?


### Tuition

According to their brochure, the total fee for a 1 year MBA is around 1.7m pesos which has to be paid by August 2023. They offer 50% schholarships and 50% loans. 


### Nano MBA

An interesting product is their Nano MBA which are remote short courses for 6 weeks that cost 350 USD at 0.5 MBA credits per course. 


### What About Placement?

Unlike other MBA programs which highlight their placement rates in big companies, GLOBIS alumni seem to focus on starting their own businesses.


### Kokorozashi

The unique selling point of their MBA program is the concept of "Kokorozashi" or self-purpose. Unlike "ikigai" which is the effect of purpose, kokorozashi is one's purpose in life itself. 

GLOBIS alumni are supposed to be able to find their purpose after graduating and get the GLOBIS network to support them with their purpose.

Unlike other MBA courses that teach mere profit maximization and maximize shareholder value, GLOBIS emphasizes social impact through kokorozashi. We think that this makes it different from the rest of the MBA pack and makes it worth your consideration.

### Ichigo World

One of the success stories mentioned was [Ichigo World](https://ichigo-world.jp/en/) which is a social enterprise that employs the community to grow and sell high value strawberries. 


<!-- seems to be. As we are experienced in SEO, web, and tech startups, we checked out its online presence to verify how successful Ichigo World is relative to other startups. 

Time is the real factor that determines success or failure, and so we'll check it out after a few years.
