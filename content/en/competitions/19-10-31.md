The Impact Hackathon is an initiative by Impacthub Manila which aims to make it to the Guiness Book of World records as the biggest hackathon in the world. 

Unfortunately, they didn't break the record this year.

The winner was Transfarm, the leader of which joined our team for a few minutes before moving on to another.
