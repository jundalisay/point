The Impact Hackathon is an initiative by Impacthub Manila which aims to make it to the Guiness Book of World records as the biggest hackathon in the world. 

## Update: Oct 31

Unfortunately, they didn't break the record this year.

The winner was Transfarm, the leader of which joined our team for a few minutes before moving on to another.
