[Hack the Hive](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-the-hive-strengthening-connections-for-the-global-pinoy-tickets-59751606664) is organized by [Free Bee](https://www.freebeecalls.com), a telecom service under PLDT of the Philippines which caters to overseas Filipinos. 

[QBO](https://qbo.com.ph) is the startup acceleration program of the Philippine government. Unlike the startup programs of Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam which are under their science ministries, the program of the Philippines is under their trade ministry, as the Department of Trade and Industry.
