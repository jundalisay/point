## Update: October 18


### Digital Transformation Program Talk

The PNP gave a talk about its Digital Transformation and Smart Policing Program. Among its vision was an independent LAN for all offices of the PNP.

### Security Operations 

A security company, making Cortex XDR, explained the problems with cybersecurity such as companies:
- having too much noise
- receiving too many low quality attacks
- having too many products to protect
- having too many repetitive tasks. 

Their company is able to monitor the security for global operations of top companies using only 22 security analysts. This is done through the use of artificial intelligence.  

<!-- Palo Alto for   -->


### DOST

The DOST also gave a talk about its roadmap and programs. 

Among its projects was [Onestore PH](https://onestore.ph/). We checked it and found it was merely a Woocommerce implementation which uses Wordpress. 

By our standards as app developers, that system is *pathetic*. Is that the best DOST-DTI can do? 

A better solution would be to fork Odoo or build one from scratch using Golang. This will make it worthy to be a nationwide platform for 110m citizens.
