The Challenge relies on using [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) which is a visualization platform by Mike Bostock who also created D3.js.



## Phases

Date | Phase

Nov 7-11, 2022 | Evaluation
Nov 15-25, 2022 | Mentoring
Nov 30, 2022 | Showcase


## Selection Criteria

- 30% Use of innovative and insightful data sources
- 30% Storytelling effectiveness
- 20% Collaborative coding
- 20% Replicability across Asia and the Pacific


<!-- Participants are encouraged to identify and explore publicly-available data from any source. Examples of innovative and insightful data sources are those that have been recently published, those that provide real-time information from data streams, those integrating multiple sensors (such as weather station and meteorological data, etc). -->


<!-- A good solution is one that tells a compelling story that can be easily understood by a variety of audiences. As participants seeks to describe climate change risk and resilience, it is important not only to approach data analytics and visualization from technical points of entry, but also to ensure that visualization convey the meaning and insights obtained from these data in a easy-to-understand and compelling manner. -->


<!-- The Observable platform aims to help people make sense of data---together. Collaborative coding may be considered as coding that starts from identifying and adapting pre-existing work shared on Observable, and re-purposing that code to suite this challenge. Collaborative coding may also be considered as team submissions demonstrating the contributions of multiple authors. -->


<!-- Research on climate change and resilience is most effective when it can be shared and adapted across time and space. Visualizations that are designed to be 'portable' from one country to another and those that may be repeated over time as new information become available to give further insights into changing trends will be prioritized for this challenge. --> 

<!-- 
he challenge is open to submissions from all individuals and teams. To formally participate, applicants must register two (2) accounts:

ADB Challenge platform
Observable
Submissions must be published on Observable. Teams must submit their Observable notebook code to ADB through the Challenge platform on or before November 4, 2022 at 23:59 PM [GMT +8].

During the application stage, Participants will be asked to provide the following as part of the registration and submission process [mandatory]:

Team introduction - Team introduction, including team members’ professional backgrounds and interests in climate data visualization and data literacy. Participants can also indicate their mentoring requests during the application period. (optional). This document should be submitted in PDF format. - Mandatory
Data Story Notebook - Data Story Notebook, which will be submitted as a .tar file downloaded from Observable and re-uploaded to the ADB Challenge platform along with a short summary of the submission and link to the publication URL - Mandatory
Data Links and Citation - Mandatory
Discussions of the techniques used to find, gather, analyze and visualize data. Mandatory
 

Parameters/Tips on Submission

Submissions must use public data. No sensitive data or code may be used. Treat all information about the content of the submission as acceptable for public disclosure.
No representation of national/country borders may be used in the submissions. Any submissions using maps showing country or sub-country administrative areas with an international borders must ensure that the maps are drawn using abstracted representations of national borders (e.g., hexbins or grid cartograms) or that map layers show only natural geographic areas, with all representations of national borders removed.
Submissions must avoid discussion of, or reference to, disputed borders, areas, regions, etc.
Submissions must not be derogatory or negative in focus; Submissions must emphasize resilience to climate change.
Submissions should focus on one or more of ADB's developing member countries or on comparisons between member regions.
The languages of Submissions should be a combination of English and JavaScript.
 
Participants must be from ADB member countries. If a participant does not upload a Submission on the Challenge platform before the deadline, this will be considered as a withdrawal from the Challenge. All qualifying Submissions will be showcased in an Observable collection.

EVALUATION
November 7-11 , 2022 
 
Up to 5 Participants' will be shortlisted to proceed to the mentoring stag -->
