The Decode Hackathon is hosted by the [Aboitiz Group of Companies](https://aboitiz.com) based in Taguig, Philippines. 

The prizes are:

1. 80,000 pesos
2. 60,000 pesos
3. 40,000 pesos


There are many challenges, ranging from feed optimization, smart grid, smart city, and transactions optimization.

It competed with another hackathon the UP OBEM Pitch 

<!-- We focused on the green energy challenge which allows business users to avail of green energy contracts under the Green Energy Options Program by the Philippine government. The problem really is that people are indifferent on where their electricity comes from. And so it would take effort to convince them to change their energy suppliers.

Buying Power will solve this by making the convincing less invasive by integrating it in a social ecommerce platform.
