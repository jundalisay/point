The PhlWC is an ideal platform to generate promising innovations, support improvements and promote scale-up of applications.  This year’s theme is water demand management to help address water scarcity issues in many parts of the country.

<p>The PhlWC provides a good opportunity for water utilities – that have innovations – to share these practical, novel and low-cost solutions that address challenges in the water sector</p> 
<cite>Libmanan Water District General Manager (GM) Rodolfo Jimenez</cite>

Mr. Jimenez' innovation, the low-cost digitization and automation solution in management of water distribution system, won grand prize last year. He joined the four other PhlWC 2021 winners in a panel discussion to share their stories of successes and challenges in scaling application of their solutions in utilities, in unserved or underserved communities, as well as in responding to disasters, such as Typhoon Odette.

The winners are in various stages of preparations for commercialization. At the end of the panel, the winners also invited new innovators to submit their solutions to the second round of the challenge.

Co-organized by USAID through its Safe Water Project, the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), Manila Water, and Maynilad, the PhlWC is an annual competition that aims to identify innovative solutions that benefit both water services providers and users, identify community demonstration projects, and promote cross-sectoral collaboration to address water challenges.

<p>It is projected that the increased demand from domestic commercial and industrial activities will exert a significant pressure on our country’s water supply system. Because of this quandary, we recognize the glaring reality that we will continue to face challenges in our goal to achieve universal access to safe water. Notwithstanding, this should be seen as an opportunity for us to creatively address such challenges with new ideas</p>
<cite>NEDA Undersecretary Joseph Capuno</cite>
