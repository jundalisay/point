[Startup Weekend](http://communities.techstars.com) is a 54-hour startup hackathon and pitching competition held in various countries, organized by Techstars. The Cambodia event focuses on fintech solutions and is sponsored by ABA Bank of Cambodia. 

This year, their focus is fintech, as they are supported by ABA Bank and CamGSM. 

Unlike other hackathons, this is really more of an ideathon where coding is not so important.
