## Update: April 2

The hackathon was not overnight, although lodging was offered for 500 pesos a night, which is absurd. 

The food was minimal. The venue was very small and had no parking even for motorbikes and bicycles. 

The SDK had extremely little documentation.


### The Good Parts

The official Xircus sample repo used Next JS on Typescript. So we were able to learn Next.js
  

<!-- Don’t be afraid if you aren’t much of a tech person and if you don’t know how to code - you are exactly the right participant for this! 

Our Xircus Web3 tool is built for that - to let the no-coders and low coders explore the exciting world and possibilities of Web3. Drag and drop and bring your long awaited idea to life - yes, it’s easy as that.

 

So, don’t think too much about it and hesitate - register today, and we see you on March 11th! -->
