The [International Rice Research Institute](http://irri.org) is an American-funded research organization, founded in 1960 by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, and is based in Los Banos, Laguna in the Philippines. It researches different strains of rice that have high yields, resilient to climate change, or are easy to grow. Bill Gates is one of the most famous backers of IRRI.
