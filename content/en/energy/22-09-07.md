## Update: September 8

There were free seminars with the following topics:

- Storage and Rural Electrification
- Renewable Energy
- Energy Products 


The talk on biomass by Mr. Tadeo caught our attention since we are also interested in environment and recycling.

The event was essential in giving us a better overview of the impact of EPIRA on the Philippine energy industry. This led us to to craft our own [suggestions for the proper energy policy](https://superphysics.org/social/economics/principles/part-1/chapter-05b).
