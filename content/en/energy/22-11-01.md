From the event, we learned of the rankings of solar manufacturers based on watts of modules shipped:

Rank |  Company | GW 2022
--- | --- | --- 
1 | JinkoSolar | 18.21
2 | TrinaSolar | 18.05
3 | LONGi | 18.02
4 | JA Solar | 15.67
5 | CSI Solar | 8.69
6 | Risen Energy | 7

As you can see, there is a big gap between the top 4 and the rest of the pack. 


### Day 2: Floating Solar Panels 

The talk on floating solar panels on the 2nd day was open to the public. It showcased the floating solar panels in Laguna Lake which survived a direct hit from typhoon Paeng.

It also included a panel discussion on financing by BPI, HSBC, and ADB for such floating solar panels. BPI advised for project developers to have a good track record and to have environmental impact assessment ready.
