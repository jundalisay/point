The Paraw is a double outrigger sail boat in the Philippines, like a bangka with a sail.

It will be the canvas that visual artist Rommel Rico aka 'Vircco' will use for his depictions of the Filipina or 'Pinay' in a month-long art exhibit entitled ‘Pinay’.

It will be held at the activity area, 4th floor, of SM City Sta. Mesa formerly SM Centerpoint. 

Vircco had success making wearable art in previous years. He has now turned to making souvenir pieces as a value-added merchandise. In collaboration with Paraw World, he has developed a miniature paraw painted with the 'Pinay' in different roles.

His art portrays pinays as one-eyed drawings, symbolizing the shackles that Filipina women are under in the Philippines. These shackles are the lack of money, education, support, etc. 

<!-- Catch and immerse in the collection and be captivated by the idea of combining crafts and art. 

With Pinay as subjects, it’s more than a collaborative and commemorative but more tributary and humanitarian as  -->

The proceeds will benefit the fisherfolk in Panay who are the makers of the real paraw craft. Vircco himself came from a poor family and helped his large family sell fish to make ends meet. 

The empowered Pinay will also be reflected in Virrco’s new collection of wearable art like the bags and shirts which will be unveiled at the launch event on March 19. The event includes entertaining numbers, a book launch with Pinay author Carmie de Leon and social media blitz and more.

It’s the second time Virrco has been featured by SM Sta Mesa since last year’s Independence day commemoration entitled Perlas Ng Silangan featuring his one-eyed woman paintings following a well-received breakthrough homecoming one-man exhibit in MetLive Atrium back in 2021.

The proceeds of merchandise for wearable art will benefit the Smile Train, a foundation that helps children with cleft palate.
