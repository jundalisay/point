## Our Impact

We are an animal shelter located in Canlalay Binan Laguna. We shelter cats, dogs, chickens, and a pig that were abandoned by their owners or were rescued during natural disasters like the Taal Volcano explosion.  


## Purpose

We are looking for the following:

- donations for the renovation of the parts of the shelter that were damaged by Typhoon Paeng 
- regular donations of animal food
- people who can adopt our animals

To donate, please leave your details with a comment at the form at the bottom of the page.
