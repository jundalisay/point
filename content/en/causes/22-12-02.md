We are looking for a donation of a second hand motorbike which we will assign to our partner in Bacoor Cavite. 

## Purpose

The motorbike will be used for:
- Transporting vegetables, seeds, and fertilizers to and from Cavite, Laguna, and Metro Manila
- Personal transport for our partner to visit local government offices and NGOs in the areas mentioned above

## Proposed Impact

The motorbike will make the transportation of the agriculture inputs and raw produce from vegetable gardens to markets faster than bicycles and cheaper than pickup trucks. 

To donate, please leave your details with a comment at the form at the bottom of the page.
