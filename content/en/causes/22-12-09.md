## Our Impact

Food Rescue Philippines is a volunteer group that collects nearly-expired food and gives them to the needy. Since 2015, We have collected and redistributed thousands of kilos of food. 

We would like to have our own domain name on the internet for a minimum of 10 years. 

However, as a volunteer organization, we do not have funds to secure such a domain. 

Our old site is at: https://foodrescueph.site/


## Purpose

We would like to ask for a donation to secure our online presence by purchasing the following:
- hosting through Google Cloud Platform at $5 per month for 10 years (around $600)
- a 10-year domain around $400

Having our own domain would help us have a space to post our updates as well as process inquiries from people and potential food donors. 

To donate, please leave your details with a comment at the form at the bottom of the page.
