## Our Impact

AMSAI school is one of many projects of the Ananda Marga Organization that caters to the local children and communities. 

Ananda Marga is a global movement dedicated to self-realization and service to all. The name is Sanskrit and literally means “Path of Bliss.” Ananda Marga was founded in India in 1955 by the late Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar (also called Shrii Shrii Anandamurti), a visionary, philosopher, and spiritual master.

Ananda Marga teaches meditation and yoga as powerful tools to help us discover deep spiritual fulfillment, peace, and wisdom. It also emphasizes a non-dogmatic code of ethics and encourages a universal outlook that rises above the limited nation, race, religion, gender, and social status.

## Purpose

We would like to ask for a donation of laptops and tablets to facilitate the online learning of our students in our Nagcarlan Laguna campus. Our students come from a poor commmunity of rural farmers. Either new or second-hand items are ok.
