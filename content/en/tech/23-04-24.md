The ASEANSAT is a collaboration project of 3 universities:

- University of Perpetual Help in the Philippines
- Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) in Malaysia
- King university in Thailand

The goal of ASEANSAT is to expose the implementation of lean satellite applications for research. 

The satellite itself has the following systems:
- On-Board Computer (OBC)
- Attitude and Determination Control (ADCS)
- Communication (COM)
- Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS)

It only focuses on the camera mission and store and forward mission. It will be used for:
- underwater surveys

- weather and environmental data gathering
- geopolitical stability
- flood vulnerability

PERPSAT1 has a control room and a command center.
