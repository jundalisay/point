The event will showcase the latest electric vehicles as well as the updates regarding the implementation of the EVIDA law. 


## Update: October 21


### Session 1: Malaysia

The Malaysian speaker talked about [the classification policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_category) of Malaysia from 2011:

- L3E for 55 kilometers per hour
- L1 for 45 kilometers per hour and below 
- Ebike <!-- 3md --> for 35 kilometers per hour and below

### Showcase: Bosch

Martin Knoss of Bosch explained that 2-wheeler prediction is uncertain because it is based on cost and not on the love for the environment. Thus, industry needs to lower its costs.  

He then showed the Bosch electrification portfolio, highlighting the importance of software for EVs. Included in this are: 
- "Access managment" to let people charge their cars easily. 
- "Health certificate" to increase the car resale value as it is dependent on the battery quality and life 


### Session 2: Thailand

The Thai speaker from the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT) explained Thailand's policy on retrofitting ICE vehicles (internal combustion engine).

Thailand has 2200 charging stations, half is AC, half is DC. The ratio of EVs to charging sockets is:

- 18 EVs to 1 charging socket (Thailand) 
- 19 to 1 is the average
- 30 to 1 is the worst

#### Challenges

He said that the biggest challenges are:
- There are no EV pickup trucks
- High household debt is biggest 14 years, 90% of Thai GDP

There are 21.487m motorbikes in Thailand 
- The Bangkok Metropolitan Admininstration aims to convert its 3500 vehicles to EVs, from motorbikes to garbage trucks 
- Bangkok has high air pollution at PM 2.5   

Knoss says that the challenge is cost because of expensive raw materials and tariffs. 
- Industry needs 8-10 years of 0 tariffs 
- Microchips shortage is affecting EV production 


#### Opportunities

Knoss says that the Philippines is not industrilaized and so EV mass production is not immediately repairable. 
- SAAS is an opportunity

The panel says that LTO participation is essential in giving standards for retrofitting 

The demand for 2 wheeled EVs is weak in Malaysia because gasoline is subsidized, leading to a price of 50 US cents per liter.

To drive demand, there are tax exemptions:
- sales tax
- road tax
- import duties

<!-- 100km is 7 kilos of CO2 per car -->

It would be nice for all jeepney manufacturers to have 1 platform to standardize parts and process. 

Thailand has "Eastern Economic Corridor" which has automative manufacturing.
- A Toyota wigo costs around 600k Thai baht  
- It costs around 20k Thai baht to convert a motorbike
- Thailand has one of a kind approach. 

Korean makers are making a conversion kit for Korean cars.

Netherlands half is threatened by sea level rise 

Parking is charging. Otherwise get a fast charger 

Netherlands is leader in ev use

Min charging 
Fast vs slow charging 
Ev depot subsidize land for operator 
Battery swapping stations 
Dunno what size for battery 
Software in battery should known the charge 
Govt develop the battery standards 

Start by fame policies zero import duty 
To import from china 
Subsidy to Japanese hybrid cars in India 
Tata electric car has already 
10k usd 300km electric car 
Needs charging infrastructure 

Start with openness before it becomes big because afterwards it might be selfish 
.
Electifiycation is cost advantages 
Focus on snychrojizwtion of ev sales and charging stations 

Big capital should spend for charging stations as their CSR 

Corporate fleet charging to jumpstart ev infra 

Being an archipelago limits range and is a blessing so slow chargers are ok 

Ac charger is cheaper than DC 

Incentives: subsidy tax reduction for ev sales. Need cheap evs not premium models. Norway has free ev carpool lanes.  Incentivize company ev cars. 

Battery replacement because of fast charging just like a mobile phone 

Ph has regulatory problems 

Hard to import the chargers because of latest rules from DTI. Need less regulation 

High energy prices is danger to Netherlands. Prices of cars. 

Buses are being electrified which is good -->
