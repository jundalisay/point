## Update: October 21


### Session 1: Malaysia

The Malaysian speaker talked about the classification policies of Malaysia from 2011:

- L3E for 55 kilometers per hour
- L1 for 45 kilometers per hour and below 
- Ebike <!-- 3md --> for 35 kilometers per hour and below

### Showcase: Bosch

Martin Knoss of Bosch explained that 2-wheeler prediction is uncertain because it is based on cost and not on the love for the environment. Thus, industry needs to lower its costs.  

He then showed the Bosch electrification portfolio, highlighting the importance of software for EVs. Included in this are: 
- "Access managment" to let people charge their cars easily. 
- "Health certificate" to increase the car resale value as it is dependent on the battery quality and life 


### Session 2: Thailand

The Thai speaker from the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT) explained Thailand's policy on retrofitting ICE vehicles (internal combustion engine).

Thailand has 2200 charging stations, half is AC, half is DC. The ratio of EVs to charging sockets is:

- 18 EVs to 1 charging socket (Thailand) 
- 19 to 1 is the average
- 30 to 1 is the worst

#### Challenges

He said that the biggest challenges are:
- There are no EV pickup trucks
- High household debt is biggest 14 years, 90% of Thai GDP

There are 21.487m motorbikes in Thailand 
- The Bangkok Metropolitan Admininstration aims to convert its 3500 vehicles to EVs, from motorbikes to garbage trucks 
- Bangkok has high air pollution at PM 2.5   

Knoss says that the challenge is cost because of expensive raw materials and tariffs. 
- Industry needs 8-10 years of 0 tariffs 
- Microchips shortage is affecting EV production 


#### Opportunities

Knoss says that the Philippines is not industrilaized and so EV mass production is not immediately repairable. 
- SAAS is an opportunity

The panel says that LTO participation is essential in giving standards for retrofitting 

The demand for 2 wheeled EVs is weak in Malaysia because gasoline is subsidized, leading to a price of 50 US cents per liter.

To drive demand, there are tax exemptions:
- sales tax
- road tax
- import duties

<!-- 100km is 7 kilos of CO2 per car -->

All jeepney manufacturers having 1 platform to standardize parts and process 

Thailand has "Eastern Economic Corridor" which has automative manufacturing.

Car 600k thai baht Toyota wigo 
20k thai baht to convert motorbike

Thailand has one of a kind approach. Korean makers are making a conversion kit for Korean cars. 

Transport is 2nd largest energy use. Village contract farming saves energy. Las pinas to calamba.
