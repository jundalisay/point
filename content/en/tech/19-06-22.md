The [Manila Maker Faire](https://manila.makerfaire.com/) is in BGC from June 22-23, 2019.

The Makerfaire is an annual event that brings together makers from all over the country. Makers are people who invent and tinker with gadgets, robots, and devices such as the Arduino board. 

Among the innovations present in the event were 3-D printing, small robots, and soldering tutorials.
