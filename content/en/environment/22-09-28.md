Villgro will showcase its startups with the theme Reduce Single-Use Plastics. 


## Update: September 30

We attended the event and watched the panel which had Plastic Credit Exchange.

A major complaint of a panelist was that refilling bottles with the actual product from the supplier is illegal. We think that this is a result of the lobbying by the manufacturers themselves, to protect their own brands.
