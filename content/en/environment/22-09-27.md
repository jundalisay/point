The German-Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry will hold a conference on Recycling and Waste Management. 



## Update: September 28


We attended the event and talked to Crispian Lao about the Plastic Waste Collection, as well as the issues with recycling in the Philippines. He asserted that community participation is essential and that the community should use the existing system of recyclers.

Interesting also was the talk by the [Solid Waste Management Association of the Philippines](https://swapp.com.ph)
