URC's "Juan Goal for Plastic" stalls will be in Robinsons Malls in selected days from October to December. People can bring in clear plastic bags to be exchanged for URC products such as:

- Piattos chips
- Granny Goose chips
- Great Taste Coffee
- Vitasoy
- Blue Cucumber drinks

The values are:

- **1 kg = 35 pesos worth of URC Products**
- 2 kg = 55 pesos worth
- 3 kg = 85 pesos worth
- 4 kg = 125 pesos worth
- **5 kg = 175 pesos worth**

As you can see, the best options are to give either 1 or 5 kilos.

## The Flaws of URC's Juan Goal for Plastic

The main problem with the URC program is the very limited choices of plastic waste that they accept. 

They accept only:
- clear plastic bags 
- sachets
- 1 kilogram minimum

They do not accept:
- plastic bottles
- plastic wraps
- colored plastic bags

An empty sachet is around 2 grams only. So it will take 500 empty sachets to make the minimum 1 kg requirement!


## The Alaska Program is Better

The recycling program of Alaska is much better. They give 150 grams of milk for every 3 kilos of plastic waste, whether PET, sachets, or plastic bags.

The milk is valued at around 40 pesos and so the value of each kilo is around 13 pesos. This is lower than the 35 pesos of URC. But it is not limited to clear plastic bags which is nearly impossible to collect in great volumes.
